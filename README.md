[CIS25] Project 1 : Banking System Program

This program uses the C++ programming language to create a program that simulates a banking system where 
users can manage different types of bank accounts, including Checking, Savings, and Business accounts. 


It allows users to interact with the program by:

 - Deposit money into their account, with a randomly generated confirmation number for each deposit.
 - Withdraw money, applying a fee based on the account type, and also a randomized confirmation number.
 - Log Transactions and a view of the transaction history that records each deposit and withdrawal, along with the date and time of the transaction.
 - Calculate interest based on the account balance and the account-specific interest rate.
 - Error handling for invalid transactions, such as withdrawing more than the available balance or attempting to enter negative amounts. [edge cases]

This program completes the the necessary objective of the assignment by implementing:

 - Variables and constants, with correct C++ naming conventions and data type use and initialization
 - Mathematical expressions and formulas that are logical, in this case, the formula to calculate the interest obtained
 - Inputs and outputs to receive and print information
 - Comment lines to help understand the code better
 - Standard library use
 - Random number function, used to print the confirmation number in each transaction
 - Correct use of booleans, arrays, loops, nested loops, use of namespace, functions, and handling edge cases.
